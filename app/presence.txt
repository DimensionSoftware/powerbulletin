* Presence and Redis
** Who
   socket.io client ids
   user ids

*** Who is online?  (...or who is in this site?)
*** Who is in this forum?
*** Who is in this thread?
*** What user is using this client id?
*** What client ids are being used by a user?  (A user can have many client ids.)

    Note, a client can only be in one room at a time.

** Where
   The room name format is as follows:

   :site
   :site/:forum
   :site/:forum/:thread

   I'm going to write code that understands these room formats,
   so that the code can behave intelligently based on what kind of
   room a person enters.

   For example, entering a thread implies entering a forum and site as well.
   However, leaving rooms is a little trickier.
   Maybe leaving a room should be handled more explicitly.
*** Should presence be applied to other types of pages?
    Profile?
    Search?
    Page?

** What are the capabilities of Redis that I might use?
*** SELECT n
    This lets me select a database using a numeric id.
    I intend to give each site its own Redis database based on its site id.
*** Sets
    Each socket.io room will be represented as a set of user ids or socket.io client ids.  I'm not sure which, yet.  Maybe both.
    Sets are useful for guaranteeing uniqueness of membership, but I don't see how I'd use any fancy set operations, yet.
*** Hashes
    If I want to treat something as a complex piece of data, hashes may help.

** Sketching out the API
   presence = new Presence $site-id
   presence.in-site!
   presence.in $room
   presence.enter $room $client
   presence.leave $room $client
   presence.user-by-client-id $client-id
   presence.clients-by-user-id $user-id
   presence.user-add-client $client-id
   presence.user-remove-client $client-id
