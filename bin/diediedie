# don't run this unless you really want to sink our battleship
# there are five exceptions to the bin/diediedie scythe of death:
#   * data sensitive (we don't wanna nuke these because they are data-sensitive
#     - postgres
#     - elasticsearch
#   * stateless conduits (they rarely need to be touched)
#     - haproxy
#     - varnishd
#     - redis-server
